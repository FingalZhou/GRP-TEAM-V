Purpose
-------

This Software Requirement Specification (SRS) identifies the
requirements and specification for the software of this project. It
explains the functional features of the animation together with design,
interface details and other considerations.

Scope
-----

The software is designed to provide visualization of sorting algorithms.
The main purpose is to help users understand the principle and
efficiency of sorting algorithms. Users should have basic understanding
of what algorithm is, such as computer science students or those
interested in sorting algorithm.

Overview
--------

The rest of the SRS presents the specifications of the software in
detail. Section 2 of the SRS is the overall descriptions of the software
and its requirements. Section 3 outlines other related requirements of
the software.

Overall Descriptions
====================

Product Perspectives
--------------------

The software is an independent and totally self-contained product
intended for use on the windows platform.

Product Functions
-----------------

The list provides a description of main features of function. These
features are divided to two categories: core features and optional
features. Core features are essential to the operation of the
application, and optional features are additional functionalities.

### Core features

1.  The software should provide users a guide of how to use
    core features.

2.  The software should allow users to select which sorting algorithm to
    be animated.

3.  The software should visualize the processes of running
    sorting algorithm. For example, bars’ movement represent the output
    of two input numbers’s comparison when users choose bar chart to
    virsualize the sorting algorithms.

4.  The software should allow users to start, stop, slow down, speed up,
    restart or pick up a point of the animation.

5.  The software should show the running soring algorithm’s source code
    to users.

6.  The software should match specific line of running soring
    algorithm’s source code and it’s explanation with animation.

7.  The software should allow users to compare the efficiency of
    different sorting algorithms by showing the amination of them
    simultaneously in the interface.

### Optional features

1.  The software should provide the voice service of
    algorithms’ explanation.

2.  The software should allow user to share this application to Social
    Network Services(SRS) website.

3.  The software should allow user to customize the preferences
    of interface.

4.  The software should allow user to download the source code.

Specific Requirements
=====================

1.  Capacity\
    The maximum number of sorting algorithms in comparison function is
    limited to 2.

2.  Software Language\
    All coding will be done in Java SE8 and CSS.

3.  Online User Documentation and Help System Requirements\
    The software should allow user to download the source code to
    local address. All documentation will be made in accordance with
    requirements pertaining to open source software under the GNU
    General Purpose License. Additionally, on-line user documentation
    will be in the form of Java Platform, Standard Edition 8
    API Specification.
